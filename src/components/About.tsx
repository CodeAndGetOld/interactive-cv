        I am currently co-founder at a software development company and React.js front-end
        developer, where I combine creativity from my Graphic Design background with the utility of
        code, to create web platforms. I am always looking for something new to keep me motivated,
        constantly looking for challenges and tasks that require logical thinking. Also, I like
        dogs.
